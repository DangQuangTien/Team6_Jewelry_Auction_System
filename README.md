Jewelry Auction System Overview:

This platform is designed for both bidders and sellers who aim to buy and sell jewelry at optimal prices. It offers a comprehensive suite of features that enhance the auction experience.

A. Jewelry Auction System:

The system provides a wealth of information about auctions, including details about upcoming and past auctions, auctioneers, and auctions conducted by specific auctioneers. Bidders can add favorite auctioneers and auctions, send emails to auctioneers, and participate in auctions (pre-bid, bid, view current and starting bids, and access bidding history). The system also showcases the sellerâ€™s catalog, alerts bidders to the auction schedule, displays a calendar of auctions, and manages direct payments. Bidders can register via mobile phone or Gmail to receive notifications.

B. Auction Request (Selling Jewelry):

Sellers are provided with comprehensive information about selling jewelry on this platform, including the steps to request an auction. Sellers can fill in details about the jewelry to be auctioned and contact the managers via Gmail or mobile phone. They can post products, specify bidding time and price, view bidding information, and edit their profile information.

C. Bidding Auction (Buying Jewelry):

The platform displays auction introduction information, allows filtering by categories and lot numbers, and enables searching by name or lot number. Bidders can add auctions to their favorites, register to bid, adjust personal information, shipping address, and credit card details. The system alerts users about ongoing auctions and provides detailed bidding information.

D. Administrator:

Administrators can set the welcome screen, declare and assign user permissions, send notifications to bidders, display the auction schedule, and manage detailed information about bidders, sellers, and auctioneers. They can also track bidding auctions and view dashboard statistics data of successful and failed auctions. Administrators have the ability to manage products, departments, users, bids, and generate reports.
